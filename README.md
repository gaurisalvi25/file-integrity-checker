#  FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER

A **Python-based File Integrity Checker** that uses SHA-256 hashing to detect if files have been modified, deleted, or newly created.  
Perfect for monitoring critical files for changes — useful in cybersecurity, system administration, and compliance tasks.

---

##  Features
- Generate SHA-256 hashes for files.
- Store hashes in a JSON database.
- Detect:
- **Modified files** (hash changed)
- **Deleted files** (file missing)
- **New files** (not in database)
- Easy to run and modify.

---

##  How It Works
1. **First run** → Generates hashes for all files in a folder and stores them.
2. **Next runs** → Compares current hashes with stored ones.
3. **Reports** any modifications, deletions, or new files.
